## Description

The purpose of this project is to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This sort of application or web page is commonly in use on secure websites so having an understanding of how to build and execute such an app is important.

The user has access to sensitive data and needs a means of creating strong passwords ensuring greater security.

### Project Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password  
WHEN I click the button to generate a password  
- [x] I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria  
WHEN prompted for password criteria  
- [x] I select which criteria to include in the password  
WHEN prompted for the length of the password  
- [x] I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters  
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password  
- [x] I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters  
WHEN I answer each prompt  
- [x] My input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected  
WHEN all prompts are answered  
- [x] A password is generated that matches the selected criteria  
WHEN the password is generated  
- [x] The password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
